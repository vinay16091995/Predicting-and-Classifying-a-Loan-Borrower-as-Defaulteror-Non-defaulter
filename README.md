# Capstone Project: Predicting and Classifying a Loan Borrower as Defaulteror Non-defaulter

## Abstract

Banks and corporate financial firms are the entities that provide loans to individuals and businesses. The former entities are called lenders and the latter are the borrowers. Borrowers take loans from lenders to satisfy their short-term and long-term financial goals. For individuals, financial goals can be buying a house, higher education, etc. and for businesses, it could be for investing in infrastructure, expanding operations, or increasing working capital.Banks/financial firms make a profit from the interest that is levied upon these loans. In general, these entities carry out analysis to determine if loans are made on feasible terms and if potential borrowers can and are willing to pay back the loan. For this, they use some metrics like current financial standing, previous credit history, and some other variables as input and obtain a measure of safety on the loan that determines the probability that the borrowers will pay back the loan (principal and interest). The main objective of this project is to make predictions on whether an individual/business is eligible for a Loan or not, using machine learning techniques. The motivation for this study is to help bankers make better use of these
state of art machine learning algorithms to prevent them from being loan defaulters.
